Feasibility of Features in 2 Months
1️⃣ AI-Powered Posture Correction – ✅ Possible (Basic Version)

Use OpenPose (Python) or MediaPipe (Google’s library) for real-time posture tracking via a phone camera.
Implement basic feedback (correct/wrong posture alerts) instead of a full AI coaching system.
2️⃣ Gamification & Social Features – ✅ Possible (Basic Version)

Add a progress tracker, badges, and daily streaks.
Integrate Firebase for a simple leaderboard and friend challenges.
Avoid complex multiplayer features for now.
3️⃣ Temperature & Mood Sensing Mat – ⚠️ Partially Possible

You can integrate basic sensors (e.g., DHT11 for temperature, GSR for stress levels) using Arduino or ESP32.
Real-time sensor data can be displayed in an app.
More advanced AI mood analysis may take longer.
